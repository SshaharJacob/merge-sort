Here I present a program that implements merge-sort so that the
size of the buffer on which sorting is based is limited to 50 MB.

For using, make sure output.txt is exist and empty.
For regular sorting, use this parameters:
A inputFile output.txt columnToSort tempPath
For example: A textFile output.txt 2 /Desktop

For selecting (sub-string), use this parameters:
B (or C)  inputFile output.txt columnToSort tempPath columnToSelect subStringToSelect
For example: B textFile output.txt 2 /Desktop 1 ab

You can use the file I supplied fileGenrator.jar to generate files larger than the
one I provided (textFile). for do so, use this command:
java -jar path_of_utility output_file number_of_columns number_of_lines
